This is a Linux based honeypot. Python ,ruby and shell scripting is used to develop Npot. 
The network based honeypot is designed to open the same ports is the local machine as on the target address. Then it also clones the services running on the port.
Requests made to these ports are recorded in a separate log file and also displayed in terminal for live analysis.
For wordpress related targets we have designed  a forked version of wordpot honeypot. 
Net data is a tool used to monitor the local systemâ€™s resources.
The activities of network based honeypot and web based honeypot will be saved in separate log files and also the live activity will be displayed in seperate terminals.
A firewall is also use to secure networks.
